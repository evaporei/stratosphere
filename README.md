# statistics

Basic statistics utility library for Rust.

I'm doing this library for learning purposes.

## Features 

- [x] mean
- [x] mode
- [x] median
- [x] variance
- [x] standard deviation
- [ ] make the code and efficiency of mode better. It is by far the worst written function
- [ ] try to make time efficiency of standard_deviation be Big Θ(3n) instead of Big Θ(4n)
